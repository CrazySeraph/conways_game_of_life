			<h1>Conways game of Life - Kiste Edition</h1>
			<p>Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game is a classic example of emergence, where complex patterns arise from simple rules.</p>
			<p>This implementation of the game uses Pygame and Numpy libraries to create the simulation, and PyQt6 library to create the UI. The game board is a 100x100 grid, where each cell can be either alive or dead. The game starts with a random configuration of cells, and the user can interact with the board by clicking on the cells to toggle their state, or using the space bar to start/pause the simulation.</p>
